## How to Run Locally

Because the game uses JavaScript modules, run it through a local static server instead of opening `index.html` directly.

### Option 1: Python

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: Node.js

```bash
npx serve .
```

## Gameplay Notes

- The player earns coupons by clicking the active artifact.
- Upgrades increase income or reduce emission damage.
- The daily bonus can be claimed once per day.
- Progress is stored locally in the browser, so clearing browser data resets the save.

## Roadmap Ideas

- More artifacts with unique passive effects.
- More upgrade types and balancing improvements.
- Achievements.
- Mobile-first layout improvements.
- Save import/export.
- Separate settings menu.
